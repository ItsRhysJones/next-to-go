ARCHIE JOHN HILL (2) showed good pace from out wide and was prominent throughout before fading out of it when 8th at Cambridge in a Class 4. Form here at the trip sound including three wins. Has a blistering 18.27 best time at this course and distance. Has ability and can atone. MARCUS (8) had the drop on the lead and went on to be beaten 0.6 lengths into second (18.50) at this track in a Class 4 over 318m. Didn't win last time but still ran one of the quickest times on the card. Well-placed to take this out. BASELINE (3) is always hard to beat when he races here at this trip."
